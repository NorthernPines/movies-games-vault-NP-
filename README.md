## Description
The user can either select to search for a movie or video game reccomendatione based on a movie or game of thier choice.  We used RAWD and OMDB api.
Our biggest challenge was on how to approach filtering certain video game genre's to work with movie searchs due to certain genres such as 'fps, rpg, casual, competitive, sandbox' need to be filtered to either equal a different word for a movie genre.
